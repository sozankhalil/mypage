                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>(born August 15, 1990) is an American actress. The world's highest-paid actress in 2015 and 2016,
                        her films have grossed
                        over $6 billion worldwide to date. She appeared in Time's 100 most influential people in the
                        world list in 2013 and the
                        Forbes Celebrity 100 list from 2013 to 2016.

                        During her childhood, Lawrence performed in church plays and school musicals. At age fourteen,
                        she was spotted by a
                        talent scout while vacationing in New York City with her family. She moved to Los Angeles and
                        began her acting career
                        with guest roles on television. Her first major role was as a main cast member on the sitcom The
                        Bill Engvall Show
                        (2007–2009). She made her film debut with a supporting role in the drama Garden Party (2008),
                        and had her breakthrough
                        playing a poverty-stricken teenager in the independent mystery drama Winter's Bone (2010).
                        Lawrence's career progressed
                        with starring roles as the mutant Mystique in the X-Men film series (2011–2019) and Katniss
                        Everdeen in The Hunger Games
                        film series (2012–2015). The latter made her the highest-grossing action heroine of all time.

                    <h2>Early life and education</h2>
                    <p>Jennifer Shrader Lawrence was born on August 15, 1990, in Indian Hills, Kentucky to Gary, a
                        construction company owner,
                        and Karen (née Koch), a summer camp manager.[5][6][7] She has two older brothers, Ben and
                        Blaine.[6] Her mother raised
                        her to be "tough" like her brothers, and would not allow her to play with other girls in
                        preschool, as she deemed her
                        "too rough" with them.[8] Lawrence was educated at the Kammerer Middle School in Louisville.[8]
                        She did not enjoy her
                        childhood due to hyperactivity and social anxiety, and considered herself a misfit among her
                        peers.[6][9] She has said
                        that her anxieties vanished when performing on stage and that acting gave her a sense of
                        accomplishment.[9] Her school
                        activities included cheerleading, softball, field hockey and basketball, which she played on a
                        boys' team coached by her
                        father.</p>
